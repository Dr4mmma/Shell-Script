# Shell-Script
A program that works as a standalone shell that acts like linux shell

# What you'll learn in this project?

You'll learn in this project how to build and design a simple UNIX shell that acts simillar like the kernel used in Linux.

## A shell is an interface between the user and the system, I've tried to make one as easy to use as the kernel in Linux.

### What I've done in this project? 

I've created a new functions that used a very complicated coding and time to do but easy to use by the user, and also i've called some functions that are already
available in the linux system such as: exit, pid, ppid, cd, pwd, get, set.
This project made me see how systems work and how functions work behind the interface.
